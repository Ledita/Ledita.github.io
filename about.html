  <h1>Hello!</h1>
  <p>
    Tell me where to go, tell me what to do<br>
    I'll be right there for you<br>
    Tell me what to say, no matter if it's true<br>
    I'll say it all for you<br>
    I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling<br>
    Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?<br>
    What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in<br>
    Because I don't belong in this world<br>
    That's why I'm scoffing at authority, defying often<br>
    Flying off at the handle with my mom, no dad<br>
    So I'm non complying at home, at school I'm just shy and awkward<br>
    And no I don't need no goddamn psychologist<br>
    Trynna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems<br>
    Thinking he can try and solve them<br>
    I'm outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk<br>
    And in the front drive talking to myself<br>
    Either that or inside hiding often toâ€¦<br>
